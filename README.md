# Marble Knockout Simulation

Welcome to the **Marble Knockout Simulation** project!

## Description

The **Marble Knockout Simulation** is a 2d Unity simulation. The simulation spawns bouncy marbles that bounce around a platform. The barriers keeping the marbles on the platform are removed and the last marble on the platform at the end is the winner.
